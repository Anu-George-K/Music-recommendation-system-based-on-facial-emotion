ðŸŽ¶Music Recommendation System Based on Facial Emotion Detection

Hai,
I'm excited to share a fun and innovative project I've been working on using Python and some amazing libraries. This project combines computer vision, emotion analysis, image manipulation, and music recommendations, resulting in a unique experience that detects your facial expression and suggests music that matches your mood!

Description: ðŸŽ¶ Created a captivating music recommendation system that uses facial emotion analysis to suggest music based on the user's mood. ðŸ“¸ The system captures an image of the user through the webcam, sketches their portrait, and detects their dominant emotion. The sketched image is then overlayed with the detected emotion, creating a visually engaging experience. The system plays music tailored to the user's emotion, enhancing the mood with carefully curated tunes. ðŸ”Š This interactive application was developed using Python, OpenCV, Streamlit, and the DeepFace library for facial emotion analysis. The integration of YouTube player functionality adds an extra layer of interactivity, allowing users to enjoy recommended music seamlessly.

ðŸ“¸ Capture and Analyze: With the help of the cv2 and deepface libraries, I've created an interactive Streamlit app that captures an image of your face. This image is then analyzed to determine the dominant emotion you're expressing. Using various image processing techniques, I create a captivating pencil sketch of your face, overlaying the detected emotion.

ðŸŽ­ Emotion to Music: Based on your dominant emotion, the app suggests music that complements your mood. I've integrated YouTube music links into the app for easy listening. For example, if you're feeling happy, it'll play upbeat tunes, while sad emotions might lead to more soothing melodies

ðŸŽµ Play Your Mood: The app even includes an embedded YouTube player, allowing you to instantly listen to the recommended music that matches your detected emotion. It's a fantastic way to explore how different emotions connect with music and experience an artistic representation of your feelings.

ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This: This project showcases the power of blending different technologies to create a multi-sensory experience. It's not just about coding but about understanding human emotions and translating them into a creative and enjoyable encounter. Whether you're curious about AI, music, or just looking for a unique way to spend your time, this project has something for everyone.
